[24/02/2021] Horizontal subdiagram connections
	- cannot represent groups by moving subdiagrams
		- messes up indexing
		- cannot check equality of indices

	- must implement `TracingTree`, instead of `TracingVec`

[24/02/2021] Indexing consistency
	- selection might be invalidated after an operation
		- when the cells move, their timeless indices change

	- can be resolved by:
		- keeping index histories
		- implementing a `TracingTree`
		- making indices reactive
