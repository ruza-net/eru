[24/02/2021] Horizontal subdiagram connections
	- cannot represent groups by moving subdiagrams
		- messes up indexing
		- cannot check equality of indices

	- must implement `TracingTree`, instead of `TracingVec`

[24/02/2021] Indexing consistency
	- selection might be invalidated after an operation
		- when the cells move, their timeless indices change

	- can be resolved by:
		- keeping index histories
		- implementing a `TracingTree`
		- making indices reactive

[03/04/2021] Conclusion
    - indexing consistency is achieved by not retaining the indices in app state
        - indices will be adjusted after each operation, so they never become invalid
    
    - grouping is implemented by nesting `TracingVec`s into `Cell`s
        - this isn't as elegant as a `TracingTree`, but is simple enough
        - must change in the future in favor of `TracingTree`, since this isn't scalable
    
    - there were problems with horizontal spacing; resolved by group-based `Spacer`
        - it mimics the tree structure but only retains the widths
        - it's handed the upstream subdiagrams and renders them inside containers of its respective width
        - this ensures the upstream subdiagrams are spaced accordingly
    
    - there's no backlog, so no undo
        - this would require an incremental representation, so a whole rewrite
        - this is desirable in a future implementation
